# AskRedditScrapingWordClouds

Hi there. Welcome to the AskRedditScrapingWordClouds Repository.

There is one file for this application to be run. The file is a python script which allows for a user to work directly with the data science product.

Essentially, there will be multiple subreddits to choose from (hopefully everything) along with an additional option of choosing whether you want to see the top posts, hot posts, controversial, rising or new posts.

Behind the screen, this will enable users to tokenize the text and see it in a form of a WordCloud which will visually show the user what might be the top grossing discussion within that subreddit. Currently, it shows the following:
- Announcements
- Funny
- AskReddit
- Gaming
- Aww
- Pics
- Music
- Science
- Worldnews
- Videos

Currently still needs some work done
- Work needed to get the type of reddit whether hot, top, controversial, rising, or new.
- WordCloud has to be put up for title and text columns along with a limit increase for posts.
- Try to upload to personal website server
